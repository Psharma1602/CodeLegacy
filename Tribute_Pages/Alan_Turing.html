    <p style="text-align: left;font-size: x-large;color:black;"><i><b>Alan Turing in full Alan Mathison Turing(born June
                23,1912), London. He was a
                British mathematcian and logician
                who made contributions to <u style="color:black;">mathematics , cryptanalysis , logic , philosophy</u>
                and mathematical
                <u style="color: black;"> biology</u> and also the new areas later <u style="color:black;"> computer
                    science , cognitive science ,
                    artifical intelligence and artifical life</u> By early 1942 the cryptanalysts at Bletchley Park were
                decoding about 39,000 intercepted
                messages each month, a figure that rose subsequently to more than 84,000 per month‚Äîtwo messages every
                minute, day and night. In 1942 Turing
                also devised the first systematic method for breaking messages encrypted by the sophisticated German
                cipher machine that the British called
                ‚ÄúTunny.‚Äù At the end of the war, Turing was made an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British
                Empire (OBE) for his code-breaking work.
                What mathematicians called an ‚Äúeffective‚Äù method for solving a problem was simply one that could be
                carried by a human mathematical clerk
                working by rote. In Turing‚Äôs time, those rote-workers were in fact called ‚Äúcomputers,‚Äù and human
                computers carried out some aspects of the
                work later done by electronic computers. The Entscheidungsproblem sought an effective method for solving
                the fundamental mathematical problem
                of determining exactly which mathematical statements are provable within a given formal mathematical
                system and which are not. A method for
                determining this is called a decision method. In 1936 Turing and Church independently showed that, in
                general, the Entscheidungsproblem
                problem has no resolution, proving that no consistent formal system of arithmetic has an effective
                decision method.

                        determined not to miss his first day of school that he cycled the 97km from his home in
                        Southampton. His teachers worried that he
                        leaned too heavily towards maths and science, at the expense of the classics. The headmaster
                        wrote to his parents: "If he is to be

                        the Bombe, a device for decrypting the messages sent by Germans using their Enigma machines. The

                        Polish had already made, called the Bomba Kryptlogiczna. Turing used statistical techniques to

                        possibilities in the code-breaking process using probability.</p>

                        This is extremely helpful for the
                        Allies during the Battle of the Atlantic as it could help them avoid the fearsome German
                        U-boats, which had been responsible for
                        sinking more than 700 Allied ships with 2.3 million tons of vital cargo.</p>

                        seminal paper Computing Machinery and
                        Intelligence) which became that attempted to define a standard for machine intelligence, which
                        would later become known as the
                        Turing test. The core idea was that a computer could be said to "think" if a human interrogator
                        could not tell it apart, through
                        conversation, from a human being. Turing also worked with his former colleague D G Champernowne
