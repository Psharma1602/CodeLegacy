     <left><pre><p>Annie Jean Easley was an American computer scientist, 
mathematician, and rocket scientist.She was born on 
April 23,1933.She worked for the Lewis Research Center 
of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
(NASA) and its predecessor, the National Advisory 
Committee for Aeronautics (NACA).She was a leading member 
of the team which developed software for the Centaur 
rocket stage,and was one of the first African-Americans 
to work at NASA.Easley was posthumously inducted into 
the Glenn Research Hall of Fame in 2015. On February 
1, 2021, a crater on the Moon was named after Easley by 
the IAU.Before the Civil Rights Movement, educational and 
career opportunities for African-American children were 
very limited. Segregation was prevalent, African-American 
children were educated separately from white children,and 
their schools were often inferior to white schools.Annie's
mother told her that she could be anything, but she would 
have to work at it. She encouraged Annie to get a good 
education.From the fifth grade through high school, Annie 
attended Holy Family High School, and was valedictorian 
of her graduating class.At a young age Annie had interest 
in becoming a nurse, but around the age of 16 she decided 
to study pharmacy.</p></pre></left>

    <span class="title-word title-word-1">CAREER</span></h2>
    <p>In 1955, Easley read a story in a local newspaper about twin sisters who worked for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics(NACA)as "computers".She applied for a job the next day, and was hired two weeks later - one of four African Americans out of about 2500 employees. She began her career as computer at the NACA Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory (which became NASA Lewis Research Center, 1958â€“1999, and subsequently the John H. Glenn Research Center) in Cleveland, Ohio.Later after electronic computers started being used at NASA her title changed to mathematician and computer technician.</p>
